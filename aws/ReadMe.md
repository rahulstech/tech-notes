## AWS Services Hands-On Lessons

### Introduction

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base as I prepare for the AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification through hands-on learning and exploration of key AWS services. Each service is documented in its own Markdown file, capturing lessons learned, core concepts, configurations, best practices, and practical CLI examples. The goal is to build practical understanding through experimentation (e.g., using LocalStack for local testing), with notes evolving as deeper topics like lifecycle management are explored. Whether you're preparing for AWS certifications or just diving into cloud infrastructure, these notes provide concise, actionable insights.
